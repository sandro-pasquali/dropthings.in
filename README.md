## Config

You will need to set up application keys with Github (OAUTH login), and set up access keys for AWS S3 (so that you can upload files).

You will be taken through the configuration process whenevery you run `npm start`. If you would like to later change configuration settings try `npm run config`. Note that previous settings are preserved, so you can run `npm run config` as often as you like -- you won't have to re-enter on each run.
